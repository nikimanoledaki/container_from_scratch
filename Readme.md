# Container from scratch

This project follows this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TsSmSu57Zo) by Liz Rice (Aqua Security), which was a talk she did at Container Camp.

## Description
The aim of this project is to replicate `docker run` command by codding the following container parts in Go:
- Namespaces
- Rootless containers
- Cgroups
- Fork bomb

## Get started
```
git clone http://github.com/nikimanoledaki/container_from_scratch
cd container_from_scratch
go run main.go
```
